#Wallet


This is a wallet application. That can be used to manage your spending.

##setup
All that is need to is:
*pull project
*migrate db
* go to localhost3000 and start adding transactions via link.



Things it will give you:
*The total amount spent in the current calendar month
*The total amount spent in the prior calendar month
*The total number of transactions in the current calendar month
*The total number of transactions in the prior calendar month
*The biggest expense in the current calendar month
*The biggest expense ever
*The total number of transactions ever
*A link to the list of transactions
*A link to create a new transaction

My estimate was 5 hours.
Realistically, I think this could have been done in probably 2 hours.
I think I spent more time thinking about it before I started, than I did coding.
The only thing I couldn't complete fairly easily was the
`The name of the place/person where you have spent the most money (over all time)`
